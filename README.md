### Replication related material for hyperloop study

1. The application version we profiled;

2. the script to populate the database for each application;

3. summary of issues we collected (and studied) from applications' issue-tracking systems.

4. summary of API misuses, and the instances/examples of misuse we find in the applications we studied.

We also provide [docker images](https://hub.docker.com/u/icse2018acm/) that contain the application code (before and after fix) and the synthetic data we used for experiments.
